Integrating with SendGrid
To integrate with SendGrid's SMTP API:

Create an API Key with at least "Mail" permissions.
Set the server host in your email client or application to smtp.sendgrid.net. This setting is sometimes referred to as the external SMTP server or the SMTP relay.
Set your username to the string apikey. This setting is the exact string "apikey" and not the API key itself.
Set your password to the API key generated in step one.
Set the port to 587 (or as specified below).

SMTP ports
For an unencrypted or a TLS connection, use port 25, 2525, or 587.
For a SSL connection, use port 465.
