  group naming
    avoid dashes, underscore fine
    don't name group same as host
    can be nested. groups of group use xxx:children suffix
    ranges pattern matching [Start:End] - numbers or letters

    -u override remote_user
    -b privilege_escalation
    -K prompt password for escalation
    --become-method
